# Credential Management

While most of the services a community uses can be managed via LFX Project Control Center, there are some external services and tools that are currently not able to be managed, such as...

- DockerHub
- Twitter or other social media accounts
- Package management services ( ex. PyPi )

In these situations, it is best to create a secure password vault for the community to use. This password vault should at minimum...

- Be easily accessable and integrate with browsers and workflows
- Securely store credentials, including MFA tokens
- Allow levels of management ( ex. view only, ACLs, etc )

The best service currently for this is 1Password, which conviently provides an open source projects plan our communuities can use. More details at https://github.com/1Password/1password-teams-open-source
